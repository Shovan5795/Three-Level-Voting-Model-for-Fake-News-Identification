Fake or misleading information detection is attracting researchers from all around the world in recent years as both society and
the political world are greatly influenced by it. Moreover, various popular social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. have
accelerated the increase in the dissemination of rumors, false cures, conspiracy theories in the forms of posts, articles, videos, URLs during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Thus there is an extensive need to find new techniques to verify or check the reliability of the online contents, which has
inspired us to conduct this research to automatically detect misleading
information. Our main aim is to create a three-level voting model to
categorize the information into two classes: ‘real’ or ‘misleading’. Five
conventional mining algorithms and three ensemble models have been
deployed with two distinct feature extraction techniques accompanying
multiple sets of n-gram profiles on a benchmark dataset. Our research
outcome shows that the Linear Support Vector Machine algorithm and
Bagging ensemble model classifier have carried out significantly in
recognizing misleading information which has been surpassed by our proposed novel three-level voting scheme. Our proposed model yields the
best performance using TF-IDF for feature extraction with 96% accuracy.
